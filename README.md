# Financial ACL Support for Reports

## biz.jmaconsulting.financialaclreport

This extension not relevant if your site has not enabled financial ACLs.

Financial ACLs allow sites to restrict create, read, update and delete operations by role by financial type. It wasn't feasible to make those changes in an extension and so they are in CiviCRM core. 

However, adding support for restricting viewing of financial information in all relevant reports causes a performance degradation on some large sites. 

So the relevant changes for the reports has been packaged into this extension.
